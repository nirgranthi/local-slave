use statusModel to lock the inputbox
lmao i just noticed the sidebar is actually collasping on small screen. i thought it didn't. it still needs a lil polishing
the ai needs context
update 'no model loaded' in the header
for the isDownload variable, we will fetch it from local storage and cross check it using the url


ill work on the local storage at last stage
