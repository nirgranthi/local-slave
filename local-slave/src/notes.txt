use statusModel to lock the inputbox
i just noticed the sidebar is actually collasping on small screen. i thought it didn't. it still needs a lil polishing
the ai needs context
update 'no model loaded' in the header
for the isDownload variable, we will fetch it from local storage and cross check it using the url
fix the new chat button
add context to the model
add gracefully model switching
add option to add custom links for model download
add dynamic header
new chat button fix
disable input box when model is not loaded
add options to switch between multiple uploaded models
format the ai reply. idk why it is being deformatted 
make downloaded models green
add customising button in the sidebar for customing the model


ill work on the local storage at last stage
